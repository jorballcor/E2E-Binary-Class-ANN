# E2E Binary Classification with Artificial Neural Networks

Welcome to the **E2E Binary Classification with ANN** project!  
This repository showcases an end-to-end solution for binary classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).  
Dive in to explore how we preprocess data, build models, and evaluate performance in a streamlined workflow.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **`POC-classification/`**: Contains proof-of-concept notebooks and scripts for binary classification tasks.
- **`POC-regression/`**: Includes proof-of-concept materials for regression analysis.
- **`data/`**: Directory for datasets used in the project.
- **`logs/`**: Stores training logs and model performance metrics.
- **`utils/`**: Utility scripts and helper functions to support the main codebase.
- **`app_exiting_classif.py`**: Main application script for executing the binary classification pipeline.
- **`app_salary_regression.py`**: Application script dedicated to salary prediction using regression techniques.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get up and running with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jorballcor/E2E-Binary-Class-ANN.git
cd E2E-Binary-Class-ANN
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```


### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will do the trick, but if you want to feel *REAL* speed, you should check [*uv documentation*](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependencies management.

### 4. Run the Application

This project uses Streamlit for local and web deployment. Streamlit is the main library for launching the applications.

#### To run the apps locally, use the following commands:
For binary classification:

```bash
streamlit run app_exiting_classif.py
```

For salary regression:
```bash
streamlit run app_salary_regression.py
```

#### Online Deployment
Both applications are also available online. Here are the links:

- [Churn prediction app](https://e2e-binary-class-ann-ku6mnpgbqxjbcuprxqje8m.streamlit.app/)
- [Salary prediction app](https://e2e-binary-class-ann-kfzui3bk4p8blemug22dkh.streamlit.app/)
